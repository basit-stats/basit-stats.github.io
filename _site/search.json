Before joining NC State, I received my Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Applied Statistics from the University of Dhaka, where I was fortunate to be co-supervised by Prof.¬†A.H.M. Mahbub Latif and Prof.¬†Abdus S Wahed. In summer 2025, I worked as a research assistant with Prof.¬†Luo Xiao on functional data analysis.\nMy research interests include causal inference, functional data analysis, and survival analysis. I am always excited to connect with fellow researchers and collaborators. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to connect!"
