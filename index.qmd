### About me

Hi, welcome to my personal website!

I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at NC State University, advised by Prof. [Shu Yang](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/syang24/). Before joining NC State, I received my Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Applied Statistics from the University of Dhaka, where I was fortunate to be co-supervised by Prof. [A.H.M. Mahbub Latif](https://www.du.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_details/ISR/985) and Prof. [Abdus S Wahed](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/biostat/people/faculty/abdus-wahed-phd). In summer 2025, I worked as a research assistant with Prof. [Luo Xiao](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/lxiao5/) on functional data analysis.

My research interests include **causal inference**, **functional data analysis**, and **survival analysis**. I am always excited to connect with fellow researchers and collaborators. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to connect!
